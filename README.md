# non-NPC story
Opening new browsing web4 portals IRL.

1. As a user, I set 3 intentions for various paths to choose, then cleanse & shuffle my IRL tarot deck
2. As a user, I pull 3 cards and patch the directions with the various paths.
3. As a user, I make a decision on a path, and make a uniswap swap to allocate resources to a direction.
4. As a user, I go outside to a nearby arbr tree & login.
5. As a user, I see a drop down of recommended NFTs to purchase with the taste of the tarot card direction I chose.
